**Version 1.5** (Updated as of 02/04/2025)

## Overview

Freezerworks Processor is a Python-based GUI application designed to automate various processes within the Freezerworks system. The application provides three primary functionalities:
- **Process Patient Sample** – Processes sample data and prints PDF labels.
- **Freeze Passaged Cells** – Manages aliquot creation for passaged cells with associated PDF label generation.
- **Aliquot Freezer Assignment** – Updates aliquot freezer location assignments using CSV input.

The program uses Bearer Token authentication to securely connect with the Freezerworks API, and it includes features such as CSV template generation, SSL certificate verification, and real-time logging.

**Note:** This project was originally developed for lab-specific operations at the Sholler Lab, Penn State College of Medicine. You may need to customize the code to fit your particular requirements.

  Place the file `freezerworks.pennstatehealth.net.crt` in the same directory as the script/executable.
- **Access to the Freezerworks API:**  
  Ensure you have valid API credentials and network access.

## Setup

1. **Clone or Download the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Freezerworks-Processor.git
   ```
2. **Verify the SSL Certificate:**  
   Ensure that `freezerworks.pennstatehealth.net.crt` is in the repository directory.
3. **Run the Application:**
   - **Executable:**  
     If available, double-click `Freezerworks Processor.exe` to launch.
   - **Python Script:**  
     Run the following command:
